# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe — AI Powered (Java + GitHub Actions)

Welcome to my interactive **Tic Tac Toe AI Game**, fully powered by  
**Java**, **Minimax AI**, and **GitHub Actions**!  

You are **X**  
AI is **O**

Every time you make a move, GitHub Actions runs Java code that:  
✔ Applies your move  
✔ Reads the difficulty (easy/medium/hard)  
✔ AI makes its move  
✔ Updates the board below LIVE

## ✨ How to Play

1. Scroll down to the **game board**.
2. Click on any tile (e.g., `[ 1 ]`, `[ 2 ]`, …).
3. GitHub will open the **Play Move** workflow.
4. Click **Run workflow** → the board updates automatically!

## 🎚 Difficulty Levels  
The community controls the AI difficulty using the **Vote Difficulty** workflow.

| Difficulty | AI Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🟢 easy | Random moves |
| 🟡 medium | Wins if possible, blocks X, takes center |
| 🔴 hard | **Unbeatable Minimax AI** |

To change difficulty:

1. Go to **Actions → Vote Difficulty**  
2. Click **Run workflow**  
3. Choose: `easy`, `medium`, or `hard`
